vercel link

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### Other Static Hosts
The form is a single HTML file and can be deployed to any static hosting service:
- Netlify: Drag and drop the HTML file
- GitHub Pages: Push to `gh-pages` branch
- AWS S3: Upload as static website
- Any web server: Just upload the HTML file

## 🔄 Future Integration: Neon CRM

The form is ready for Neon CRM integration. When ready:

1. Create backend API endpoint
2. Replace `saveToLocalStorage()` with API call in form
3. Use existing data structure (already matches Neon CRM fields)
4. Implement sync for pending localStorage submissions

See `IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` for detailed integration guide.
